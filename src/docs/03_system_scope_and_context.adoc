== System Scope and Context

Our routes application will be managed following the SOLID standards. In other
words, this tool will be decentralized which means that this application will allow each user to store and share their own personal
routes without fearing any company using their data in ways they have not approved. However, we have some limitations, for example it would be more difficult
to use and manage. Despite of this facts, this application is supposed to be interoperable, which means that it does not matter which application you use
the data is the same for all of them.

==== Used APIs

The communication with the Solid API is done through the following libraries:

- https://github.com/solid/solid-auth-client[solid-auth-client]: Authentication of users and handling of their credentials.
- https://github.com/Otto-AA/solid-acl-utils[solid-acl-utils]: Generation and handling of `.acl` files for managing POD permissions.
- https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-file-client[solid-file-client]: Creation, retrieval and manipulation of files and folders in PODs.
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/rdf-query[rdf-query]: Obtaining RDF information from PODs, mainly used for processing user profiles.

The communication with the maps API is done through the https://leafletjs.com/[Leaflet] library.
