== Risks and Technical Debts

There are several risks and practical debts in the developing of this
application for the managing, in a decentralized way, of the routes of an user.

.Table with Risks and Technical debs and a possible way of minimizing them
|===
|Possible Risk |Risk description | Possible solution/hotfix
|Solid
|The use of Solid implies using a new experimental technology with not a lot of documentation.
|Keeping a record every action in the project and the use of a version control system, so a possible rollback could be done.

|React
|The developers didn't ever use this framework.
|The only way to solve this is expending time of the project learning how to use it, and by try-and-fail.

|University
|As the members involved in this project are currently attending the University, and some of them might be in several years at the same time, it's difficult to focus a lot of time in this project.
|A possible way to mitigate this huge problem is being extremely careful of how the developers expend their time, so they must be professional and organized.

|Travis-ci
|The use of a continuous integration tool is new for the developer team.
|A solution would be the familiarization with the configuration file of the tool.
