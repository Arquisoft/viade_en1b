== Solution Strategy

=== Introduction

In this section you will find the technology decisions and solutions strategies like architectural patterns. Futhermore, we have reasoned why we chose them.

=== Decisions
The project is developed using the following technologies:

| Decision | Purpose
| ReactJS  | We will use this JavaScript library to build the user interfaces
| Solid | We have to store the user data in a Solid POD, which will allow us to make the application interoperable and descentralized
| Node JS | We will use it for modules management
| Model-View-Controller | We will use this architectural pattern in order to insolate the presentation layer from the business layer allowing us to be for flexible
| Organizational decisions | We have decided to work in an incremental way, using braches for each new functionality and when it comes to push it to the master branch we need to put a pull request.
| Test-Driven-Development | We agreed to write the tests first, so this will allow us to work faster when we have to extend the functionality of the application and be always sure if what we are doing is right
| Travis  | Automatically build code, test code and provide and inmediate feedback of the success of the changes
| Coveralls | Hosted analysis tool which provide stadistics about our code coverage
| Code Quality | Write quality code and make it understandable, using the readme for external users understand how the application works and provides information
