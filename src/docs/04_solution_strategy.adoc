== Solution Strategy

=== Introduction

In this section you will find the technology decisions and solutions strategies that we have chosen. Furthermore, we have reasoned why we choose them.

=== Decisions
The project is developed using the following technologies:

|===
| Decision | Purpose | Advantage | Disadvantage
| ReactJS  | We will use this JavaScript library to build the user interfaces | It makes front-end understandable, easy and fast | At the start of the project, we had no idea nor experience working with React
| Solid | We have to store the user data in a Solid POD, which will allow us to make the application interoperable and descentralized | The information of each individual will be managed by each individual | Solid is still on development and is not easy to work with
| Node JS | We will use it for modules management | It offers a wide offer of package via npm | You have to be careful with the packages that you install as the may have vulnerabilities
| Model-View-Controller | We will use this architectural pattern in order to isolate the presentation layer from the business layer, allowing us to be for flexible | Fast development | MVC architecture is difficult to understand
| Organizational decisions | We have decided to work in an incremental way, using a branch dev for all the development of the application. Each functionality will be implemented in a new branch, when we need to commit changes to the dev branch we need to make a pull request. After everything is working on dev, we will make a pull request to master | We are sure that the final application has less errors, the pull request will ensure the review of other members of the team so they can give you feedback | You have to be careful when pushing changes and do not forget to make pull requests
| Test-Driven-Development | We agreed to write the tests first, so this will allow us to work faster when we have to extend the functionality of the application and be always sure if what we are doing is right | The implementation is previously tested, so you can ensure that the code you are writting is right or wrong | It is more tedious to use this type of development
| Travis  | Automatically build code, test code and provide and inmediate feedback of the success of the changes | It gives you an automatic feedback of your code, so you don't merge branches that are not mergeable | Sometimes it may confuse some commit and set them as wrong when they are fine
| Coveralls | Hosted analysis tool which provide stadistics about our code coverage | It gives you an stadistical percentage of test coverage of the application | 
| Code Quality | Write quality code and make it understandable, using the readme for external users understand how the application works and provides information | It gives you a feedback of the code quality stadistics with a grade |
