== Building Block View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image:05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

=== Whitebox Overall System

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

node ViaDe {
    [Solid module] as solidmod
    [Map module] as map
    [Route interpretation] as routes
    [React] as react
}

node "Solid server" {
    database "User's POD" as pod
}

node "Maps service" {
    () "Maps API" as imaps
}

:User: --> react
react --> map
map --> routes
map --> imaps
routes --> solidmod
react --> solidmod
solidmod --> pod
----

Motivation::

The system must handle routes defined externally, communicate with a Solid POD
where they are stored and present a user interface built with React. These are
three separated responsibilities and each of them can be contained in its own
module.

Contained Building Blocks::

[options="header"]
|==============================
| Building block       | Description
| React                | Offers an interface to the system for the final user.
| Route interpretation | Offers an interface to routes to other modules.
| Node module          | Offers an interface to the Solid POD.
|==============================


Important Interfaces::

_<Description of important interfaces>_

[role="arc42help"]
****
Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.

==== React graphical interface

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe <black box 1>
according the the following black box template:

* Purpose/Responsibility
* Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs. This interfaces may include qualities and performance characteristics.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box, e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....
* (Optional) directory/file location
* (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to requirements).
* (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

****

Responsibility::

Offers an interface into the system for the final user.

Interface::

This module does not provide interfaces to other modules of the system.

Quality/Performance Characteristics::

The graphical interface must accord to the Solid style guide. It must also be
responsive enough for final users to interact with the system without problem.

_<(Optional) Directory/File Location>_

_<(Optional) Fulfilled Requirements>_

_<(optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks>_

==== Map module

Responsibility::

Provides a map for the routes to be represented on.

Interface::

Provides an interface to show and interact with routes.

Quality/Performance Characteristics::

The maps must be precise and expressive enough for the routes to be easily
interpreted by as many final users as possible.

_<(Optional) Directory/File Location>_

_<(Optional) Fulfilled Requirements>_

_<(optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks>_

==== Route interpretation

Responsibility::

Deals with the routes format.

Interface::

Offers representable routes.

Quality/Performance Characteristics::

Handling of routes must be responsive enough to not affect the flow of the
application.

_<(Optional) Directory/File Location>_

_<(Optional) Fulfilled Requirements>_

_<(optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks>_


==== Solid module

Responsibility::

Knows the Solid protocol and interacts directly with PODs.

Interface::

Offers an interface to Solid data.

Quality/Performance Characteristics::

Must fit the standards of Solid data representation and exploit the benefits of
linked data.

_<(Optional) Directory/File Location>_

_<(Optional) Fulfilled Requirements>_

_<(optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks>_


==== <Name interface 1>

...

==== <Name interface m>



=== Level 2

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system

=== Level 3

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 2 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
part of arc42 for additional levels.
