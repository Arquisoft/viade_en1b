== Introduction and Goals

The aim of the project is to create a decentralized routes management system based on the <<solid_definition,SOLID>> framework allowing users to control their own personal data.

- Our application will consist of a decentralized architecture where user's data is separated from the app.
- Users can store their routes in their own <<pod_definition, PODs>>.
- Users can visualize the routes stored on a map.
- The app will allow a user to share pictures, videos or information about a route with other friends.
- A user can get notifications when some friend shares a route with him.
- Users can have groups of friends to share the routes with.
- It should be possible to view routes loaded by users that are using a different app, so interoperability with other route management systems should be taken into account.

=== Optional Requirements
- The system could be mobile compatible.
- Users can share their routes in real time.

|Priority| Goal         | Motivation | Scenarios
|1| Usability |The app must be easy to use by non-technical people. | As a new user, I want to be able to use the app without needing any external help.
|2| Privacy    | Users must be the owners of their own data. | As a user, I want to be able to choose where I want my own data to be.
|3| Effectiveness | Users must be able to share their routes according to the functionalities of the system. | As a user, I want to be able to share my routes with my contacts.
|4| Interoperability | The system must be able to communicate with other similar SOLID apps | As a user, I want to be able to share the routes loaded in my application with other similar SOLID apps.
